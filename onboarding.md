# Onboarding

CFDE members use a number of services to communicate and share files:

  -   Github: Code sharing, organization and deliverables tracking
  -   groups.io: mailing lists
  -   Google Drive Teams: file sharing
  -   Slack: Group chat, forum and instant private messaging

To gain access to these resources, please complete the following steps. Invitations should be received within 2 business days and must be accepted within 5 business days. 

## Complete these four steps:

1. Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/wsBAYevSQNVfG5eF9).
2. Accept an invitation to join the cfdeworkspace.slack.com on Slack
3. Accept an join nih-cfde on GitHub
4. Read the confirmation emails for our mailing lists and google drive. If you did not receive these emails, please check your spam folder.

By the end of this onboarding process, you should have access to the [CFDE Github](https://github.com/nih-cfde), [mailing list](https://cfdepublic.groups.io/g/CFDEPublicMain), shared Google drive, and slack. Until you have completed onboarding, you will not be able to view some links.

You can see the status of your onboarding progress by finding your name in the [Onboarding Responses Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).

## Fixes to Access Problems

### GitHub

If you cannot find your GitHub invitation, follow this link to accept on the web: [https://github.com/nih-cfde](https://github.com/nih-cfde)

For help configuring your GitHub notifications and other settings see the [GitHub Help](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/CommunicationManagementHelp.md#github-help) section of the CFDE Communication Management Overview

For help with how to interact with GitHub (e.g. how to submit a pull request) see our [GitHub User Guide](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/projectmanagement/GitHubUsage.md)

Before you start contributing on GitHub, you may want to learn about [Markdown](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/projectmanagement/MarkdownHelp.md).

### groups<span>.io</span>


You may need to add `CFDE@groups.io` to your safe sender list in your email clientâ€™s contacts
to reliably receive mailing list emails.

For help configuring your groups.io mailing frequency and other settings see the [groups.io Help](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/CommunicationManagementHelp.md#groupsio-help) sections of the Communication Management Overview

### Google Drive

You must be logged into Google Drive using the email you specified in your onboarding form. You will have access to two different CFDE drives.

 - [CFDE Admin](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AIspdLMpflayUk9PVA): Everyone has view access to this drive. It contains files related to maintaining
 the CFDE infrastructure and files that need to be locked from direct editing such as the contact
 list created by the onboarding form
 - [CFDE Everyone](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ALAyQumxL5IgUk9PVA): Everyone has edit access to this drive. It contains the bulk of CFDE files and
 is the main place for collaboration

On the left side of the screen, you should see a button for Team Drives. You may need to click on the small arrow to see the list of drives you have access to.

If you have trouble accessing drives, or believe you have been assigned the wrong permissions,
please email the [Help Desk](mailto:support@cfde.atlassian.net)
