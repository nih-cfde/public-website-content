# Science and Technology Research Infrastructure for Discovery, Experimentation, and Sustainability (STRIDES)

The NIH [Science and Technology Research Infrastructure for Discovery, Experimentation, and Sustainability (STRIDES)](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides) initiative partners with commercial cloud providers to supply discounts and credits for cloud services. To date, STRIDES has established partnerships with [Google Cloud](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-makes-strides-accelerate-discoveries-cloud) and [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/amazon-web-services-joins-nihs-strides-initiative-harness-latest-cloud-technologies-biomedical-researchers). STRIDES also provides access to professional service consultations and technical support from STRIDE partners, reports on spending and usage, and account usage monitoring.

Through STRIDES, funding is available for cloud storage, compute and egress for DCCs and other NIH-funded initiatives after their contract or grant period has expired. Programs apply for a specific amount of funding to cover cloud expenses, and once approved, invoices go directly to STRIDES and are paid out of the approved pool of money. When the pool is exhausted, programs can apply for additional funds. The process for applying for funding involves the following steps:

1. Set up STRIDES account for project.
    - Contacts:
        - Simon Twigger (Security/STRIDES)
        - Todd Reilly (STRIDES)
2. Fill out application for funds.
    - Links to application forms to fill out - Bob will send
    - HMP - application sent to Laura (program officer) and ultimately approved by Betsy Wilder (head of CF)
3. Establish a security plan and obtain STRIDES approval.
