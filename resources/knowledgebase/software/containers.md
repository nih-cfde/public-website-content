# Containers

An application container overcomes the challenges associated with running software in different computing environments by combining the code and its dependencies in a lightweight package that runs reliably and uniformly across platforms. Containerizing an application involves creating a container image that contains all of the required components for running the application, including the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. On the userâ€™s system, a container engine uses the container image to create a container that is isolated from the compute environment and runs the software.
