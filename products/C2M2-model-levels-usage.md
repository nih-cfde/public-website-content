## What can a researcher use the model levels for?

**Level 0 and Level 1:** Levels 0 and 1 consist entirely of unprotected metadata terms, and therefore likely to represent data from all Common Fund Programs. These two levels are sufficient to support two minimal [Use Cases](https://cfde-usecases.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/use-cases/). 

**Level 1 and Level 2:** Using only the metadata from Levels 1 and 2, [a researcher can find datasets](https://cfde-usecases.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/use-cases/uc0001-researcher-browse-and-filter/) from across the Common Fund that contain information about tissue of interest, assayed using a method of choice. Similarly, [staff at the NIH can compare the tissues, species and assay types available across DCCs](https://cfde-usecases.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/use-cases/uc0003-monitor-data-releases-as-a-data-custodian/).

More complex Use Cases, such as the [ability for a researcher to find datasets for patients with a specific disease in a specific age range](https://cfde-usecases.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/use-cases/uc0005-researcher-browse-and-filter-complex/) will require the Programs to submit protected metadata terms. However, this is a limitation of our current infrastructure which makes our access to protected data illegal, and will be solved in the near future.
