## Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Training Resources

The CFDE's training website (https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/) hosts tutorials and resources about accessing NIH Common Fund program metadata/data and performing common bioinformatic analyses. We are building training materials to facilitate finding and re-analyzing existing datasets! Upcoming workshops will be announced here and on the CFDE twitter account (@CfdeNih). Past workshops are listed on the training website home page.

Updates to the website are detailed on the [Release page](https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/Release-Notes/). In 2021, we will be adding more lessons focused on conducting bioinformatic analyses using a variety of cloud-based platforms, including the [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/), [Seven Bridges Genomics' Cavatica platform](cavatica.sbgenomics.com/), and the [Broad Institute's Terra platform](https://terra.bio/)!

### Performing analysis in the cloud
R03 researchers are eligible to participate in the [NIH STRIDES program](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides), which includes discounted rates to either AWS or GCP and user support/training. See the [STRIDES FAQ](https://cloud.cit.nih.gov/files/STRIDES-Initiative-Frequently-Asked-Questions.pdf) to get started.
