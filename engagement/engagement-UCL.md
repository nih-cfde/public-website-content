## Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Use Case Library

The CFDE's Use Case Library (UCL) (https://use-cases.nih-cfde.org/) captures essential scientific objectives and places them in the context of larger goals in the CFDE timeline. The UCL helps us to spell out details about the who and the what of use cases we'd like to support and turn them into reality.

To help our library grow to include more use cases for clinical researchers, data scientists, and others interested in reusing data for biomedical research, we welcome and encourage you to contribute to the library! As detailed in the [contribution guide](https://use-cases.nih-cfde.org/CONTRIBUTING/), please submit use cases or ideas for use cases you'd like to see supported by the CFDE!
