# Engaging Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers to Establish the Common Fund Data Ecosystem

Common Fund programs are intended to provide resources that accelerate discovery across many different biomedical research fields. Often these resources include large data sets and associated digital tools needed to mine and analyze the data. To maximize impact, these data sets and tools must be leveraged by researchers from different disciplines, with varying expertise in bioinformatics and large- scale data analysis. Additionally, these data sets must be usable together across interoperable platforms. However, current approaches to data storage, management, and analysis mean that data are often not Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).

The Common Fund Data Ecosystem Coordinating Center is looking forward to working with all of you, and we encourage you to reach out to Amanda or Owen at the Coordinating Center, or to describe your ideas to the slack channel so we can help identify other groups that may have a common interest.Â
