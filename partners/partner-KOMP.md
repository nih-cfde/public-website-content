## [Knockout Mouse Phenotyping (KOMP)](https://www.mousephenotype.org/understand/the-data/)

The **Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2)** collaborates with the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) to knockout and characterize all protein-coding genes in the mouse genome. Knocking out the activity of a gene provides valuable clues about what that gene normally does but creating mice with gene knockouts is a time-consuming and difficult process, and often is done by individual research labs with varied approaches. 
Since the founding of the program, KOMP2 scientists established and adhered to uniform characterization – or phenotyping – protocols, data collection, and reporting standards, and made all data available via a data portal. KOMP2 awardees, in conjunction with the IMPC, published over 120 peer-reviewed publications, including papers systematically describing genes with previously unknown function in hearing, embryonic development, and metabolism. Overall, this effort helps scientists explain the genetic basis of many different types of diseases in mice that also occur in humans, including rare diseases that have been under-studied as well as some common chronic diseases that affect much of the human population.
