# Partners with the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE)

The CFDE Coordinating Center oversees CFDE activities and works closely with participating data coordinating centers from other Common Fund Programs (or partners) on an initial subset of data sets, with plans to expand to additional CF data sets in the future. The CFDE portal is also developing and deploying a number of resources and tools, including training materials, to empower the research community to use CF data sets for novel scientific research that was not possible before. This may include hypothesis generation, discovery, or validation that leads to new insights in health and disease.


## [4D Nucleome (4DN)](https://data.4dnucleome.org/)

The goal of the **4D Nucleome (4DN)** program is to study the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus in space and time (the 4th dimension). The nucleus of a cell contains DNA, the genetic “blueprint” that encodes all of the genes a living organism uses to produce proteins needed to carry out life-sustaining cellular functions.

## [Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx)](http://www.gtexportal.org/home/)

The **Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)** project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. Samples were collected from 54 non-diseased tissue sites across nearly 1000 individuals, primarily for molecular assays including WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq. Remaining samples are available from the GTEx Biobank. The GTEx Portal provides open access to data including gene expression, QTLs, and histology images.

## [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/)

The **Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)** is committed to developing the next generation of molecular analysis technologies, computational tools, and to generate foundational tissue maps in order to accelerate the construction of an atlas of the human body for the understanding the relationship between tissue organization and function. HuBMAP values secure, open sharing, and collaboration with the wider research community.

# [Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program](https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/dashboard)

The **Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center** enables researchers, clinicians, and patients to work together to accelerate research and promote new discoveries for children affected with cancer and structural birth defects. Data from over 11,000 samples, including DNA and RNA, is available to empower your research today. Data collected from more than 30,000 samples are expected to be available in the next few years.

## [Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)](http://lincsportal.ccs.miami.edu/dcic-portal/)

The **LINCS** project is based on the premise that disrupting any one of the many steps of a given biological process will cause related changes in the molecular and cellular characteristics, behavior, and/or function of the cell – the observable composite of which is known as the cellular phenotype. Observing how and when a cell’s phenotype is altered by specific stressors can provide clues about the underlying mechanisms involved in perturbation and, ultimately, disease.

## [Metabolomics](http://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/)

The goal of the **Metabolomics** program is to inform basic, translational, and clinical research. Metabolomics is the scientific study of the chemical reactions that occur in organisms, cells, or tissues. Each reaction produces small chemicals called metabolites, which play critical roles in keeping our cells healthy and functioning properly. Improving metabolomics methods and making them more accessible to different researchers may allow for more personalized diagnosis of disease and treatment methods.

## [Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)](https://motrpac-data.org/)

**Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)** is a national research consortium designed to discover and perform preliminary characterization of the range of molecular transducers (the "molecular map") that underlie the effects of physical activity in humans. The program's goal is to study the molecular changes that occur during and after exercise and ultimately to advance the understanding of how physical activity improves and preserves health.

## [Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions](https://sparc.science/)

The **Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC)** program aims to transform our understanding of nerve-organ interactions with the intent of advancing bioelectronic medicine towards treatments that change lives.

## [Human Microbiome Project](https://hmpdacc.org/)

The overall mission of the **Human Microbiome Project** is to generate resources to facilitate characterization of the human microbiota to further our understanding of how the microbiome impacts human health and disease. In the second phase of the HMP, the iHMP will create integrated longitudinal datasets from the microbiome and host from three different cohort studies of microbiome-associated conditions using multiple ‘omics technologies.
