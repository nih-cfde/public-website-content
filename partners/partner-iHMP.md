The overall mission of the **Human Microbiome Project** is to generate resources to facilitate characterization of the human microbiota to further our understanding of how the microbiome impacts human health and disease. In the second phase of the HMP, the iHMP will create integrated longitudinal datasets from the microbiome and host from three different cohort studies of microbiome-associated conditions using multiple â€˜omics technologies.
