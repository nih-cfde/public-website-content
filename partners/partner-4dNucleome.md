## [4D Nucleome (4DN)](https://data.4dnucleome.org/)

The goal of the **4D Nucleome (4DN)** program is to study the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus in space and time (the 4th dimension). The nucleus of a cell contains DNA, the genetic “blueprint” that encodes all of the genes a living organism uses to produce proteins needed to carry out life-sustaining cellular functions.
