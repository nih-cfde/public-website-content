## [Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)](https://motrpac-data.org/)

**Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)** is a national research consortium designed to discover and perform preliminary characterization of the range of molecular transducers (the "molecular map") that underlie the effects of physical activity in humans. The program's goal is to study the molecular changes that occur during and after exercise and ultimately to advance the understanding of how physical activity improves and preserves health.
