# Public website content  
### To view the current site design with example content, use the [Website Mockups Repo](https://github.com/nih-cfde/public-website-mockups).  

### To add content:
* Templates for each type of content can be found in the respective content type folder. Duplicate the template and rename it with a descriptive title (ex: a product page about BioJupies should be a duplicate of product-template.md in the products folder and renamed to biojupies.md).  
* Edit content using Markdown ([Markdown Help](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/MarkdownHelp.md))  
* Upload relevant images to the images folder. Please follow size and naming requirements from the content templates. If you want to replace an image, please add "-new" to the filename.  
* If adding a resources page, please indicate where your page belongs in the resources navigation by adding the page name to resources-TOC.md
* Issue a pull request to this repo with your new content.
