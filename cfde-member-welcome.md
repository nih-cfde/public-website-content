Welcome to the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Coordination Center (CC)!

The CFDE-CC is an NIH effort to identify and solve issues that inhibit data access and reuse across NIH Common Fund programs. The Ecosystem is the Coordination Center plus all of the Common Fund Programs who participate. The ultimate goal of the CFDE is for the data to be more usable and useful both within a programâ€™s own data and among datasets from multiple programs. By connecting the data and making them more accessible, the CFDE is intended to enable novel scientific research that was not possible before, including hypothesis generation, discovery, and validation.

Please take a few minutes to learn about the CFDE, its objectives, challenges and project proposals:
