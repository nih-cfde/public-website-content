If you are a new Common Fund Program that received funding to participate in the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE), you are in the right place. As you've probably heard, the CFDE is made up of the Coordination Center (CC) plus all of the Common Fund Programs who participate. It is a large program that consists of multiple, interoperable, and parallel projects across many teams and timezones -- A lot happens at the CFDE!

On this page you can find a multitude of resources that are important and relevant to your CFDE experience. These resources will give you a [brief overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BU0mlp5D3itf91NmKyll2Da5Ct-ZaEs2/view?usp=sharing) of the CFDE and help your CF Program (or DCC) [get onboarded](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qg0OGEtKYsOP657ZHFu7W5IIYCX4Psx-_n8UPA93pAA/edit#heading=h.8dy9wkax2sv1). You will also find links to resources that will help us communicate better, as well as track projects and progress in a systematic way.
